Read, decode and display the contents of a typedstream.

Where possible, the data read from the typedstream is decoded into a
higher-level structure before being displayed. Objects are decoded based on
their class when their format is known and implemented. Objects of unknown
classes are also supported, but are decoded to a generic format based on the
typedstream data.

As a result of this decoding, some low-level information from the typedstream
is discarded and not displayed, such as raw type encoding strings in known
classes, and object reference numbers. To see this low-level information,
use the read subcommand instead.
