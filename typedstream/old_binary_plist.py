"""Implementation of an old binary property list format,
apparently originally from NeXTSTEP.
This format is *not* the same as the modern Mac OS X/macOS binary property list format,
which starts with the signature string ``bplist00`` and has a completely different structure.

This format supports only the following data types:

* ``nil`` (mapped to ``None``)
* ``NSData`` (mapped to ``bytes``)
* ``NSString`` (mapped to ``str``), stored in either of the following encodings:

  * UTF-16 with BOM. Both big-endian and little-endian byte order are allowed. Mac OS X/macOS always outputs this encoding.
  * The NeXTSTEP 8-bit character set. Mac OS X/macOS never outputs this encoding, but supports reading it.

* ``NSArray`` (mapped to ``list``), which can contain any supported data type as elements
* ``NSDictionary`` (mapped to ``dict``), which uses strings as keys and can contain any supported data type as values

We care about this format because it's used in Apple's implementation of -[NSArchiver encodePropertyList:] and -[NSUnarchiver decodePropertyList],
which are in turn used by some AppKit classes,
such as NSFont.

This format is also used by the Foundation classes NSSerializer and NSDeserializer.
These classes have been deprecated since Mac OS X 10.2,
and their header (<Foundation/NSSerialization.h>) was removed from the Mac OS X SDK some time between Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.7.
However, as of macOS 10.14,
these classes are still present and usable in the Foundation framework at runtime.

There is extremely little documentation on this format or the APIs that use it,
so this implementation is almost entirely based on examining the output of the relevant NSArchiver and NSSerializer methods.
Another deserializer implementation for this format can be found in the Darling project's Foundation implementation:

# Unicode mapping of the NeXTSTEP 8-bit character set.
# This mapping was created by taking a byte string containing all bytes from 0x01 through 0xfd (inclusive)
# and decoding it using the macOS Foundation framework as NSNEXTSTEPStringEncoding:
# This can be done from Python using rubicon-objc:
# objc.py_from_ns(NSString.alloc().initWithBytes(bytes(range(1, 254)), length=253, encoding=2))
# See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_character_set,
# although the mapping on the Wikipedia page doesn't exactly match the one used by macOS.
# The Wikipedia table indicates that character codes 0x60 and 0x27 correspond to opening and closing curly quotes (‘’),
# which is also documented in the NeXTSTEP 3.3 developer documentation linked from the Wikipedia page.
# However, macOS instead maps these codes to backtick/grave accent and straight quote (`'),
# which matches their meanings in plain 7-bit ASCII.
# For compatibility with macOS,
# we use the latter mapping.
